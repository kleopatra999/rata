world - images, rooms, and stuff


Setting: An unspecified eurasian country in an unspecified decade after WWII.
          The country used to be run by a Fascist dictator, who has just been
          toppled by a Communist party.  You are a street urchin searching for
          your father, who was helping with scientific research funded by the
          old regime, and who went missing some years ago.  A lead has directed
          you toward an alley near a military base, which is above a vast
          bunker filled with strange things.

Very rough overall map...

alley - A run-down back alley with some secret passages into the bunker.
         Mostly empty but with some city-dwelling wildlife.
laboratory - Where biology experiments used to be run.  A few scientists are
              still left in one room, but the rest is a battleground between
              the robots and the mutant animals.  One library-like room is
              sealed off, and it is expected that there are clues to the
              whereabouts of the protagonist's father inside.  The secret code
              needed to get in is distributed across a bunch of research books,
              which are scattered about the bunker.  Since these books also
              contain the sum of the decades of research carried on here,
              nearly every major character wants to get their hands on them.
robot factory - A fully-automated robot factory managed by an old hacker dude.
                 Most of the robots are fairly unintelligent.
military - A military base with the last remnant of the Old Regime.  Managed by
            the dictator's most trusted general, who plans to rise back to
            power eventually.  Actually, he just really hates the North Country.
            The base is somewhat understaffed these days, but some robots
            provided by the factory make up for that somewhat.
chemical - A chemical weapons storage facility, originally part of the military
            base but a gas leak forced them to seal off the area.  It is an
            option to break in here and let loose poison gas all over the
            bunker to clear out the mutants.
underground forest - Conceived by the mad whims of "Dear Leader", intended to
                      be a place to preserve flora and fauna in the case of a
                      nuclear holocaust.  Obviously it won't work, but nobody
                      dared tell him that.
lair - Part of the underground forest that has been overrun by mutant animals.
        Managed by a human known as "Creature" who was part of the biological
        experiments, and now takes care of the mutants because of some sort of
        sense of kinship.
geothermal - The bunker is powered by a geothermal power plant, which is down
              here.  It is an option to permanently cut the power to the entire
              bunker, rendering the robot factory inert.  This place cannot be
              entered without a nearby heat suit.
