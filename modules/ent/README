ent - game actors, player controls, AI

There isn't much here yet.  The most important thing to know, however, is that
there are controlling objects and controlled objects, which are separate.  The
class for a human or robot does not read keyboard input or have any
intelligence; instead, it just recieves commands from another class, which can
represent the player or an AI.  In other words, this module implements
Cartesian dualism.  This is so that player and AI control can be switched
between entities at runtime.  See control.h for details.
