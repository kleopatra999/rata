shell - global integration, initial state, and in-game console

This program takes one optional command-line argument, which is a state file
to load from.  Otherwise the default initial state will be used.  If the
program exits normally, the final state will be saved to save/last_stop.hacc

The in-game console can be brought up by typing ` (grave accent).  A console
 command is literally just a HACC array without the square brackets.  Thus
    set $("start.hacc").rata.Object.pos [4 7]
 is the set command with two arguments; the first being a path (translated into
 a pointer) and the second being an array (translated into a Vec).
