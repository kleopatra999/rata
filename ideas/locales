Here will be listed every possible idea for areas in the game.  It's good to record these.





back alley
abandoned house
warehouse, with raccoons
rooftops
abandoned mine
underground artificial jungle

strange secret military stuff.  Lots of sneaking here.  Open courtyard
 with snipers; have to crawl below.  Need to think of a purpose for all the
 stuff...shady genetic engineering facility?  Do we want/need mutant
 monsters?

Power station, with high voltage thingamabobs

something that's off the outskirts of town, so you have to walk through a
 bit of rocky wilderness to reach it.  Perhaps the mine.

dark sewer connecting all or most areas

We need some weird places.
...how do we balance realism and weirdness?  And for that matter
 gameplayability?  How much story are we striving for?

At the bottom of the mine there can a cave with lava--and you have to wear
 a heat suit to enter.
